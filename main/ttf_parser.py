# let's calculate a checksum:
# The table directory includes checkSum, a number
# which can be used to verify the identity of and the integrity of the data in
# its associated tagged table. Table checksums are the unsigned sum of the longs
# in a table. The following C function can be used to determine the checksum of a
# given table:
#
# uint32 CalcTableChecksum(uint32 *table, uint32 numberOfBytesInTable)
#    {
#    uint32 sum = 0;
#    uint32 nLongs = (numberOfBytesInTable + 3) / 4;
#
#    while (nLongs-- > 0) sum += *table++;
#
#    return sum;
#    }

# so some of these pass, others fail...
# how is it possible to have a table length of 139? It's not divisible by 4?
#  that's why they calculate nLongs and then work off that... so just
#  use nLongs * 4 as your length
#    tests no longer fail, but neither did we gain a true
# the checksums that we're calculating are quite a bit larger than the ones
# given by the font
#  perhaps nlongs is being calculated improperly?
#    subtracting one made the two true vales negative by a small amount, but
#    didn't affect many of the false values and the ones it did affect are
#    still *way* too large
# for key in table_directory:
#    try:
#        checksum, offset, length = table_directory[key]
#        nlongs = (length + 3) / 4 #will fail in py3k
#        mysum = sum(unpack(">%sI" % nlongs, buf[offset:offset+(nlongs*4)]))
#        print key, checksum, mysum, checksum == mysum or mysum - checksum
#        i = 0
#        #while mysum > checksum:
#        #    nlongs -= 1
#        #    mysum = sum(unpack(">%sI" % nlongs, buf[offset:offset+(nlongs*4)]))

# FWord 	xMin 	Minimum x for coordinate data
# FWord 	yMin 	Minimum y for coordinate data
# FWord 	xMax 	Maximum x for coordinate data
# FWord 	yMax 	Maximum y for coordinate data

# and for a simple glyph:
# uint16 	endPtsOfContours[n] 	Array of last points of each contour; n is the number of
#                                   contours; array entries are point indices
# uint16 	instructionLength 	Total number of bytes needed for instructions
# uint8 	instructions[instructionLength] 	Array of instructions for this glyph
# uint8 	flags[variable] 	Array of flags
# uint8 or int16 	xCoordinates[] 	Array of x-coordinates; the first is relative to (0,0),
#                                   others are relative to previous point
# uint8 or int16 	yCoordinates[] 	Array of y-coordinates; the first is relative to (0,0),
#                                   others are relative to previous point

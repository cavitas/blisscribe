Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who \
was the farmer's wife. Their house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles. \
There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, \
a cupboard for the dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in \
one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in another corner.  There was no garret at all, and no cellar--except a small \
hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds \
arose, mighty enough to crush any building in its path. It was reached by a trap door in the middle of the floor, \
from which a ladder led down into the small, dark hole.

When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see nothing but the great gray prairie on every \
side. Not a tree nor a house broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all \
directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass, with little cracks running through it. Even the \
grass was not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the same gray color to be \
seen everywhere. Once the house had been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it away, and \
now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.

Call me Ishmael. Some years ago-never mind how long precisely-having little or no money in my purse, and nothing \
particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. \
It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim \
about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing \
before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get \
such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into \
the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off-then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.\
 This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I \
 quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, \
 some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.
There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs-commerce \
surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is the battery, where \
that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look \
at the crowds of water-gazers there.
Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by \
Whitehall, northward. What do you see?-Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon \
thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; \
some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as if striving to get a still \
better seaward peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster-tied to counters, nailed to \
benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here?

DFW = "I am seated in an office, surrounded by heads and bodies. My posture is consciously congruent \
to the shape of my hard chair. This is a cold room in University Administration, wood-walled, Remington-hung, \
double-windowed against the November heat, insulated from Administrative sounds by the reception area outside, \
at which Uncle Charles, Mr. deLint and I were lately received.\
\nI am in here. \
Three faces have resolved into place above summer-weight sportcoats and half-Windsors across a polished pine \

Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or \
 twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, `and \
 what is the use of a book,' thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'
So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), \
whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when \
suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.

There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit \
say to itself, `Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that \
she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a \
watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed \
across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, \
and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a \
large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.

The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice \
had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.

Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about \
her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, \
but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with \
cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of \
the shelves as she passed; it was labelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did \
not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell \
past it.

`Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave \
they'll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which \
was very likely true.)

Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end! `I wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said \
aloud. `I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, \
I think--' (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though \
this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it \
was good practice to say it over) `--yes, that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude or \
Longitude I've got to?' (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand \
words to say.)

Presently she began again. `I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among \
the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think--' (she was rather glad there was no one \
listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the \
country is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy \
curtseying as you're falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) `And what an ignorant little girl \
she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'

Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. `Dinah'll miss me very much \
to-night, I should think!' (Dinah was the cat.) `I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! \
I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very \
like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?' And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying \
to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, `Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do bats eat cats?' for, you \
see, as she couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing \
off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, `Now, \
Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and \
dry leaves, and the fall was over.

Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; \
before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment \
to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and \
whiskers, how late it's getting!' She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be \
seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.

There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the \
misc, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.

Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval \
forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing.

In the book it said: "Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they are not able to move, \
and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion."

I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making \
my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked something like this:

I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them.

But they answered: "Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"

My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups \
were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of a boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could \
see it clearly. They always need to have things explained.

DFW = "I am seated in an office, surrounded by heads and bodies. My posture is consciously congruent \
to the shape of my hard chair. This is a cold room in University Administration, wood-walled, Remington-hung, \
double-windowed against the November heat, insulated from Administrative sounds by the reception area outside, \
at which Uncle Charles, Mr. deLint and I were lately received.\
\nI am in here. \
Three faces have resolved into place above summer-weight sportcoats and half-Windsors across a polished pine \
conference table shiny with the spidered light of an Arizona noon. These are three Deans - of Admissions, \
Academic Affairs, Athletic Affairs. I do not know which face belongs to whom."

Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or \
 twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, `and \
 what is the use of a book,' thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'
So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), \
whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when \
suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.

There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit \
say to itself, `Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that \
she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a \
watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed \
across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, \
and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a \
large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing.

In the book it said: "Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion."

I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked something like this:

I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them.

But they answered: "Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?"

My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of a boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained.

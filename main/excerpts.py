DFW = "I am seated in an office, surrounded by heads and bodies. My posture is consciously congruent \
to the shape of my hard chair. This is a cold room in University Administration, wood-walled, Remington-hung, \
double-windowed against the November heat, insulated from Administrative sounds by the reception area outside, \
at which Uncle Charles, Mr. deLint and I were lately received.\
\nI am in here. \
Three faces have resolved into place above summer-weight sportcoats and half-Windsors across a polished pine \
conference table shiny with the spidered light of an Arizona noon. These are three Deans - of Admissions, \
Academic Affairs, Athletic Affairs. I do not know which face belongs to whom."

Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or \
 twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, `and \
 what is the use of a book,' thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'
So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), \
whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when \
suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.

There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the Rabbit \
say to itself, `Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!' (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that \
she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a \
watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed \
across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, \
and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a \
large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

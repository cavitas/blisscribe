Blisscribe was partly inspired by Radiolab's podcast on Blissymbols.  Blissymbols constitute an ideographic language that was invented in the 1960s by Charles Bliss.  His intention was to create a straightforward, intuitive, and universal language that would allow all people to communicate with pure semantics, without rhetoric.

Blisscribe intends to be used by individuals with language difficulties or otherwise a keen interest in alternative forms of linguistic understanding.
